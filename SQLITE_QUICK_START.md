# SQLite Quick Start Guide

**For developers who just want to get started quickly!**

---

## 🚀 You're Already Done!

The migration is **complete** and **automatic**. Your bot is now using SQLite!

---

## ✅ What You Need to Know

### 1. Everything Works the Same
All your birthday commands work exactly as before:
- `/remember-birthday`
- `/forget-birthday`
- `/birthday`
- `/next-birthdays`
- `/set-user-birthday`

**No changes needed!**

### 2. Database File Location
```
data/ubv-bot.db  ← Your database (don't commit to git)
```

### 3. Backup Your Database
```bash
npm run backup
```

That's it! Backups are saved in `backups/` directory.

---

## 📝 Useful Commands

```bash
# Create backup
npm run backup

# View database stats
npm run db:info

# Run migration (if needed)
npm run migrate

# Test database
node scripts/test-database.js
```

---

## 🔍 View Your Data

```bash
# Open database shell
sqlite3 data/ubv-bot.db

# View all birthdays
sqlite> SELECT * FROM birthdays;

# Count birthdays
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM birthdays;

# Exit
sqlite> .quit
```

---

## 💾 Automated Backups (Recommended)

Add to crontab for daily backups:
```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line:
```
0 2 * * * /path/to/ubv-bot/scripts/backup-database.sh
```
